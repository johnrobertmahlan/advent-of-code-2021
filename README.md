# Advent of Code 2021

This is year two of working through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Last [year](https://github.com/johnrobertmahlan/advent-of-code-2020) I made it through just five days.

Let's see if I can do more this year.

Like last year, I am not attempting to optimize my solutions. Solving the problems will be enough.
